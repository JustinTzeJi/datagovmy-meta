        "description": "About 70% of the Malaysian labour force is registered under PERKESO’s Employment Insurance system (EIS), which gives workers immediate financial assistance if they lose their job. As a result, SOCSO observes the Malaysian labour market in real time. For policymakers, PERKESO data is a critical complement to DOSM’s Labour Force Survey, which is 1.5 months lagged (e.g. data for May is released in mid-July) due to the time taken to conduct a representative nationwide survey. This dashboard brings you SOCSO’s high-frequency labour data, and allows you to observe various labour market trends as they unfold!",
