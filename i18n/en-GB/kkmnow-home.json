    "description": "KKMNOW is the Ministry of Health's pioneering initiative to make Malaysia health data accessible and understandable. Born out of necessity during the COVID-19 pandemic (during its first iteration as COVIDNOW), it has today evolved to cover a wider range of health-related data. Health is one foundation of a developed nation - we will keep improving the coverage and quality of data on this site to anchor the conversation on critical healthcare issues in Malaysia.",
