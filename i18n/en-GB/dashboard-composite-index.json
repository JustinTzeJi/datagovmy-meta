            "description": "The leading index is comprised of 7 indicators. The coincident index is comprised of 6 indicators. A diffusion index tells us what proportion of these indicators increased. A value of 100% indicates that all indicators forming the index increased; a value of 50% indicates that only half the indicators increased; a value of 0% indicates that none of the component indicators increased. For this reason, a diffusion index is helpful in determining whether the overall trend is broad-based, or being driven by a minority of the components."
