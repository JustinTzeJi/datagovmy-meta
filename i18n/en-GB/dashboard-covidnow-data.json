        "description": "Over 6 million users, 44 million views, and 100 million clicks later, data on COVIDNOW - powered by Google Analytics - provides a large-sample insight into how users interact with a Malaysian-based data site. Beyond providing transparency on the usage of COVIDNOW, this dashboard also yields valuable insight into how Malaysians use the web - ranging from where usage is concentrated, to what times of day saw peak traffic, to the devices people use. We hope this helps everyone looking to do something similar.",
        "combine_header": "COVIDNOW always received a steady stream of traffic, but saw huge spikes driven by shock value",
        "combine_description": "The largest two spikes in traffic were due to the launch announcement (2 mil views over its first 2 days), and Malaysia hitting the '90% of adults fully vaccinated milestone' (2 mil views in a single day). The former was likely due to massive traction on social media, while the latter was due to 90% being used as the trigger to allow interstate travel.",

This is an important lesson - in the modern age, if your site is not mobile-friendly, you instantly lose a huge chunk of your traffic.",
