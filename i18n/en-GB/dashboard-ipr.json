And so - IPR was born. The brainchild of the Economic Ministry, IPR is a two-pronged strategy to increase the income of the poor, while trying to solve daily economic problems. For this reason, IPR focuses on eradicating poverty by funnelling participants into agricultural initiatives (INTAN), vending machine businesses (INSAN) and public service operation (IKHSAN). This dashboard tracks IPRâ€™s performance transparently for all to see.",
