      "description": "Measuring the population of Malaysia is the beating heart of everything we do at DOSM. This includes measuring not only how many people live in the country, but how long they live for, or what is called ‘life expectancy’. It is a critical social indicator, not just for policymakers, but also for individuals - to accurately plan your finances after retirement, it is good to have data on how long the average person in your demographic lives for! This dashboard summarises trends in life expectancy since 1957, with breakdowns by state and demographic group.",
