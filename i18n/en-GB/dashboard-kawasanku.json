Does it have adequate public services? \n\n It is DOSM's mission to bring the answers to these questions to the rakyat's fingertips. Following the completion of Population and Housing Census of Malaysia 2020 (MyCensus 2020), DOSM released population data at Parliament Constituency and State Legislative Assembly level for the first time in history. The Kawasanku dashboard is intended to give citizens, policymakers, and the international community an accessible way to explore the dataset.",
