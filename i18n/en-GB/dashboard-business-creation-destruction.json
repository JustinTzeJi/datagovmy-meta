        "description": "As in most countries, Malaysia's private sector is comprises as much larger share of GDP than the public sector, and is therefore primarily responsible for job and value creation. Furthermore, a vibrant and thriving business environment is a key indicator of a healthy economy. In Malaysia, the Companies Commission (SSM) is the single source of truth on this matter - all businesses, companies, and LLPs in operation must be registered with SSM to operate legally. Powered by their registry, this dashboard summarises trends in business creation and destruction.",
